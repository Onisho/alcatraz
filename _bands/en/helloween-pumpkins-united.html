Many years have passed since German power metallers Helloween blew us away with the spine-breaking speed metal anthem ‘Ride the Sky’. Hansen concentrated on guitar duties when Michael Kiske joined in 1986 and the blonde nightingale mans the mic on both ‘Keeper of the Seven Keys’ albums, which were their greatest commercial successes. Then Hansen left and Kiske got fired. Record sales dwindled but eventually they got back on track with new lead singer Andy Deris, albeit with a more melodic sound than before. Meanwhile Kiske appeared lost to metal and Hansen was doing great with Gamma Ray.
