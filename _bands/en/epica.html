<p><br></p>To <b>some</b> the rock veterans of Status Quo might seem the odd band out on this year’s bill but the legendary rockers are masters at playing a crowd. In the 70s they were the poster boys for the so-called denim brigade with vintage albums such as ‘Piledriver’, ‘Hello’ and ‘Quo’. Their intense and driving boogie rock has raised an army of air guitar heroes across the globe and over the years an avalanche of hits has endeared them to rock and metal fans worldwide. Disaster struck on Christmas Eve 2016 with the untimely demise of rhythm guitarist and figurehead Rick Parfitt but the Quo endured.
